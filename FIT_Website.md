# Project Description  
**Problem:** Gerrymandering poses a threat to our democracy; it has the potential to make voting obsolete.  
Representatives manipulate district lines to control the voting outcome using two popular strategies; packing and cracking.  
Packing involves grouping like-minded individuals into one district as a way to keep them "contained".   
Cracking is used to split like-minded individuals up in order to dilute their votes, thus making them ineffective.  

Our proposed solution is to create an unbiased, user friendly algorithm by utilizing census data.  
The goal is to make voting districts that are compact, preventing the dilution or concentration of specific demographics.   
Different social and economic communities will be considered, ensuring that their voices are represented.   
We plan to make our algorithm accessible and easy to use by implementing a GUI that will provide a visual   
representation of our proposed voting districts.
