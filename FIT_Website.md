# Project Description  
Gerrymandering poses a threat to our democracy; it has the potential to make voting obsolete.  
Representatives manipulate district lines to control the voting outcome using two popular strategies; packing and cracking.  
Packing involves grouping like-minded individuals into one district as a way to keep them "contained".   
Cracking is used to split like-minded individuals up in order to dilute their votes, thus making them ineffective.

Our proposed solution is to create an unbiased, user friendly algorithm by utilizing census data.  
The goal is to make voting districts that are compact, preventing the dilution or concentration of specific demographics.   
Different social and economic communities will be considered, ensuring that their voices are represented.   
We plan to make our algorithm accessible and easy to use by implementing a GUI that will provide a visual   
representation of our proposed voting districts.


The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor, in the form of a Capstone project proposal.

## Requirements

### District Drawing Algorithm

A critical component of FairyMander lies in its ability to fairly draw voting districts, necessitating the development
of an algorithm that, when given a state, can fairly draw voting district lines. To ensure the quality of this algorithm,
research, expert opinion, and varying factors between states will be used to develop the most fair redistricting policy possible. It is
anticipated that this will be the most significant component of the project in terms of development time, as it requires a great deal of 
thoughtful analysis to create and implement in a way that is fair and applicable to all 50 states.

### Before and After Comparison For an Individual State

To illustrate the capabilities of FairyMander, a user will be able to compare a state's voting district lines before and after
our algorithm is applied to it. This will provide both a visual aid for the aforementioned algorithm and a method of communicating
how fair districts can be drawn to the user.

### Interactive U.S. Map

As a comprehensive display of what FairyMander can do, an interactive map will be used to enable users to select a particular state
and observe how the algorithm applies to said state. This will not only allow users to easily find state(s) of interest, but will also 
display the effectiveness and widespread application of the redistricting algorithm.
