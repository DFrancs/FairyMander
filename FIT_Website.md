# Project Overview



## Problem



## Requirements

### District Drawing Algorithm

A critical component of FairyMander lies in its ability to fairly draw voting districts, necessitating the development
of an algorithm that, when given a state, can fairly draw voting district lines. To ensure the quality of this algorithm,
research, expert opinion, and varying factors between states will be used to develop the most fair redistricting policy possible. It is
anticipated that this will be the most significant component of the project in terms of development time, as it requires a great deal of 
thoughtful analysis to create and implement in a way that is fair and applicable to all 50 states.

### Before and After Comparison For an Individual State

To illustrate the capabilities of FairyMander, a user will be able to compare a state's voting district lines before and after
our algorithm is applied to it. This will provide both a visual aid for the aforementioned algorithm and a method of communicating
how fair districts can be drawn to the user.

### Interactive U.S. Map

As a comprehensive display of what FairyMander can do, an interactive map will be used to enable users to select a particular state
and observe how the algorithm applies to said state. This will not only allow users to easily find state(s) of interest, but will also 
display the effectiveness and widespread application of the redistricting algorithm.
