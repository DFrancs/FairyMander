# Project Description  
**Problem:** Gerrymandering poses a threat to our democracy; it has the potential to make voting obsolete.  
Representatives manipulate district lines to control the voting outcome using two popular strategies; packing and cracking.  
Packing involves grouping like-minded individuals into one district as a way to keep them "contained".   
Cracking is used to split like-minded individuals up in order to dilute their votes, thus making them ineffective.
